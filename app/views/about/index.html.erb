    <p> Able Acres Farm was established in 2011 and originally located in Woodbine, NJ.  At the time, Chris DeVaney was employed at a special services school and had the idea of starting a farm that employed adult individuals with special needs.  He began working toward making his dream a reality and worked tirelessly to get the farm off of the ground, starting with his first differently abled employees, Mel and Ian.  Soon enough, the farm grew and grew, and today is located in Estell Manor and employs differently abled individuals as well as full time employees.  Organic, Non-GMO and environmentally friendly practices are at the forefront of raising the livestock and growing the produce on the farm. </p>
